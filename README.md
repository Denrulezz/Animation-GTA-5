# Animation-GTA-5 || Detective warrant

This is my first animation for GTA 5. The animation was made for "presenting a warrant" to a person.

Clip: export@badgepd2 || Anim: badgepd2

Code for RPEmotes(https://github.com/TayMcKenzieNZ/rpemotes):
```lua
   ["warrant"] = { "export@badgepd2", "badgepd2", "Warrant", AnimationOptions= {
        EmoteLoop = true,
        EmoteMoving = false,
    }},

```
